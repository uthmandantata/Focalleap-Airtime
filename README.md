# Focalleap Airtime App README

Welcome to the README file for the Focalleap Airtime App! This is a simple web application that simulates a basic mobile banking interface for checking airtime balance, buying airtime, and borrowing airtime. Users can interact with the app through prompts and receive alerts based on their selections.

## How to Use

1. **Open the HTML File**: Open the provided HTML file (`index.html`) in a web browser to access the Focalleap Airtime App.

2. **Interact with the App**: When you open the app in the browser, you'll see a prompt that provides three options to choose from:

   - Option 1: Check Balance (*123#) - Allows you to check your airtime balance.
   - Option 2: Buy Airtime (*100#) - Allows you to buy airtime by entering the desired amount.
   - Option 3: Borrow Airtime (*101#) - Allows you to borrow airtime if your balance is sufficient.

3. **Select an Option**: Type the corresponding option number or code (e.g., *123#, *100#, *101#) based on the action you want to perform.

4. **Follow Prompts**: Depending on the option you choose, you might be prompted to enter additional information, such as the amount of airtime to buy or borrow.

5. **View Alerts**: The app will display alerts based on your selections. For example, if you choose to check your balance, you will see an alert with your current airtime balance.

## Features

- **Check Balance**: Option *123# allows you to check your current airtime balance.

- **Buy Airtime**: Option *100# enables you to buy airtime by entering the desired amount. The purchased airtime will be added to your balance.

- **Borrow Airtime**: Option *101# allows you to borrow airtime if you have a sufficient balance. If your balance is zero or negative, you'll receive a notification that borrowing is not possible.

## Notes

- The app uses JavaScript to manage user interactions and update the airtime balance.

- Invalid inputs will result in an alert asking the user to select one of the provided options.

- This is a simplified simulation for demonstration purposes and does not have actual monetary transactions.

- Feel free to explore and experiment with the app to understand how the different options work.
